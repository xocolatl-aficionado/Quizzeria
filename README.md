## How To Run

### On the cloud

Simply visit our [codesandbox deployment](https://0mj3mq-3000.csb.app/) and use [these](#credentials-to-use) credentials.<br>
To view the sprint 2 codebase on CodeSandbox - [Click Here](https://codesandbox.io/p/github/mehadihn/software-engineering-project/master)
### Locally

To run the code locally, youâ€™ll need to define your environment variables through the `.env.local` file or creating a `.env` file first. For a sample `.env` file, refer to `.env.example`. Use the same mongodb url (since it is set to the team mongodb instance url) and use your appropriate localhost url for the nextauth and host keys.

Once done, go to your console and run the following commands in the order specified.

This command will install all the prerequisite packages defined in the `package.json` file required to run the project.

```javascript

npm install 
```

This command will run the project in dev mode:

```javascript

npm run dev

```

To run the test cases

```javascript

npm test

```

### Credentials to Use

Sign in with the credentials:
- Admin: `username: mehadi@mehadi.com` and  `password: 1234`.
- Student: `username: Adi@Adi.com` and  `password: 4321`.

## UML Diagrams

Previous UML diagram for Sprint 01
![UML Diagram Sprint 01](docs/UML/UML_Sprint_1.png)

Current UML diagram for Sprint 02
![UML Diagram Sprint 02](docs/UML/UML_Sprint_2.png)

- A data layer was added to separate the UI code from the backend. 
- UI layer now needs to import a concrete MongoQuizData obejct to reach the database. Therefore, the db code has been removed from the UI code. 
- The data layer implements two interfaces so that in the future we can replace mongo with another db client which implements the same interface.
- Quiz, Questions and User collection has been used in the MongoDB to support the application.
- Unit tests were written for the data layer as well as other business class that yet to be integrated end to end.


## What works?

- The user starts at the landing page.
- Signs in with the credentials. If you log in using the Admin credentials (`username: mehadi@mehadi.com` and  `password: 1234`) it should redirect to the Admin home page and if logged in with the student credentials (`username: Adi@Adi.com` and  `password: 4321`) the user will be redirected to the studnet dashboard.
- Clicking the `Retake Quiz` button will no longer reset the score as we will change the architecture around that button in the next sprint.
- Although we have a few new UI pages as well as backend for them we are yet to merge some of this changes to the master due to git conflict resolutions that are still pending.


## Available Screens for students

1. Student Dashboard
- This is the initial screen for a student logged in to the system successfully.<br/>
![student dashboard](docs/UI_Screenshots/Students/student-dashboard.png)

2. Student Quiz Bank
- This is the second tab in the Main Menu.
- This contains unattempted quizzes for the student logged in. 
- Student can select a quiz and attempt the quiz by clicking on the "Take Quiz" button along with it. <br/>
![student quizbank](docs/UI_Screenshots/Students/student-quizbank.png)

3. Student - Take a Quiz
- When a student clicks on the "Take a Quiz" button after picking a quiz to attempt, that student is redirected to this screen. 
- The default quiz contains short answer questions. <br/>
